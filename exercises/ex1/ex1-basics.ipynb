    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to make yourself familiar with LeanIX and to learn how you can find information about Enterprise Applications of your company both in the LeanIX workspace as well as via an AI Agent based on MCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "New LeanIX customers typically start their LeanIX journey with [Application Rationalization](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/apm/application-rationalization) use case. They assess their Enterprise applications in order to make sure they align with business goals. LeanIX offers two metrics for this: [Functional fit and technical fit](https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/application-portfolio-assessment-enrich-data?locale=en-US).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional fit: Does this tool do what the business needs it to do?\n",
    "- Technical fit: Can we run and support this tool effectively in our IT environment? \n",
    "\n",
    "During this exercise, we want to identify applications that fit our business goals best. \n",
    "\n",
    "We thus formulate the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Which applications have a perfect functional fit and fully appropriate technical fit?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to answer the above question: \n",
    "- first in LeanIX directly\n",
    "- later with an AI Agent via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the information in LeanIX\n",
    "1. Create LeanIX API token\n",
    "1. Use the token to connect to the LeanIX MCP Server\n",
    "1. Filter the MCP tools \n",
    "1. Connect to an LLM on AI Core\n",
    "1. Create an AI Agent\n",
