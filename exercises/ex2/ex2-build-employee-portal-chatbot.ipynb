    "# Exercise 2: Build an Employee Portal Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Exercise 2! In exercise 1 you have already learned what is a ReACt agent, how to prompt it, and how to pass MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Build an intelligent employee chatbot that connects AI agents to SAP LeanIX using Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling natural language interactions with enterprise architecture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** A functional ReAct agent capable of answering questions about applications, services, IT components, and related LeanIX fact sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning:** How to design a ReAct agent, connect MCP tools for LeanIX, and implement an interactive chat loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating SAP LeanIX can be challenging for new and non-regular users. Employees often struggle to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the right applications for their tasks (\"I need something to edit images\")\n",
    "- Understand application ownership and lifecycle status (\"What is the lifecycle status of the application Jobwatch?\")\n",
    "- Find applications with a specific business capability (\"How many applications support the business capability Contract Management?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚧 Task:** Implement a chat loop with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Welcome message when the chat starts\n",
    "- Basic error handling for failed requests\n",
    "- Proper markdown formatting for responses\n",
    "- Clear exit instructions"

    "\n",
    "### 💡 System Prompt Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Your system prompt should define:\n",
    "- **Role**: What is the agent's identity and purpose?\n",
    "- **Behavior**: How should it respond to employee questions?\n",
    "- **Information Priority**: What details are most important to include?\n",
    "- **Tone**: Professional but friendly for internal use\n",

    "**Example structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an AI assistant for [company context]...\n",
    "\n",

    "- [Primary responsibility]\n",
    "- [Secondary responsibilities]\n",
