    "# Exercise 2: Build an Employee Portal Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Exercise 2! In the previous exercise, you learned about ReAct agents and how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. Now, you’ll step into the role of an AI engineer and build a chat portal for your company.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll build a chatbot that helps employees easily find and understand IT applications using SAP LeanIX. By connecting an AI agent to LeanIX, your chatbot will answer real employee questions in natural language. We’ll use MCP and the SAP AI SDK to make this possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Make SAP LeanIX accessible to everyone at your company. You’ll build an employee chatbot that connects AI agents to LeanIX using Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling natural language conversations with enterprise architecture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end, you’ll have:**\n",
    "- A working ReAct agent that can answer questions about applications, services, IT components, and LeanIX fact sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You’ll learn:**\n",
    "- How to design a ReAct agent\n",
    "- How to connect MCP tools for LeanIX\n",
    "- How to implement an interactive chat loop with the SAP AI Core SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating SAP LeanIX can be challenging, especially for new or occasional users. Many employees just want to quickly find answers to questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the right applications for their tasks (e.g., “I need something to edit images”)\n",
    "- Understand who owns an application and its lifecycle status (e.g., “What is the lifecycle status of the application Jobwatch?”)\n",
    "- Find applications that support a specific business capability (e.g., “How many applications support Contract Management?”)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You’ll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll build the chatbot step by step:\n",
    "- Add a **system prompt** to define your portal agent’s personality and purpose\n",
    "- Show a **welcome message** when the chat starts\n",
    "- Render **responses in markdown** for clear, readable answers\n",
    "- Add clear **exit instructions** so users know how to leave the chat\n",
